            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is George Maguire. I was born in Singapore and raised
                in Saint Paul, MN. I like playing hockey, traveling and going
                to my cabin which is in Nisswa, MN.

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p> These are some the projecs that I have recently worked on. The first project is Horiseon which is the very
                first project that I have gotten to work on. The other two projects were group projects. The Issue tracker
                was a website that would be able to track issues that were academic readings. The Local Weather Park project
                was an app that would be able to track the weather in local dog parks.
